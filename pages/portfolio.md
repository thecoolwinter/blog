Computer engineering major at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I’m a fast learner with experience developing apps using Swift, Xcode, and Javascript. I love building things that can help people in tangible ways. The apps I build have been featured on the Apple App Store, and have 1,000s of active users every day.
# Experience

### Employed at Winter Family Care - iOS, MacOS Developer - March of 2020 - Present

Developed custom in-house software to move daily medical documentation to a fully paperless iPad and Web-based system which included an admin dashboard and passkey-protected kiosk and mobile apps. Developed custom payroll software, making it easier for payroll administrators to notify employees using automated emails for bi-weekly pay stubs.

### OpenBudget - iOS, iPadOS, MacOS App - [openbudget.us](https://openbudget.us/)

I built OpenBudget to make budgeting money easier. The app provides a smooth onramp into budgeting using virtual envelopes and provides useful statistical data, charts, export options and full historical transaction search. The app makes use of a Javascript backend for processing recurring transactions and user authentication. It has also been featured by Apple in the App Store.

### Fueling Timer - iOS App - [fuelingtimer.app](https://www.fuelingtimer.app)

FuelingTimer helps people using Optavia™ diets keep track of when to eat “fuelings” using local notifications. Advanced customization options allow it to be used on multiple diet plans as in transitioning to long-term healthy habits. It can also scan food labels for tracking dietary information. FuelingTimer has appeared in the top 100 apps for Utilities since its release.

### iOS Workshop Instructor - [adcumn.org](https://adcumn.org/board/)

Taught a series of workshops at the University of Minnesota App Developers Club. The workshops covered iOS development using SwiftUI using Swift. In addition to technical skills, I taught good app architecture and design concepts for building great apps.
