# Fueling Timer

[FuelingTimer][https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fueling-timer/id1453121223] is my most successful app on the iOS app store. It's a simple diet-timer app for people who follow the Optavia diet. Optavia requires you to eat 4 or 5 times a day, and sometimes it's hard to remember to eat at all those times, so I made an app that sends reminders throughout the day at specified intervals to help remind people.

# ClearBudget Î²

Clearbudget is a simple-intuitive budgeting app for everyone. Clearbudget brings all your finances together by linking your bank accounts directly to the app. It supports cross-device syncing as well, so you can keep track of your expenses anywhere. 

Clearbudget is built for regular people. It's not trying to sell you any cards or trying to get you to open a new bank account or invest in a new product. You've already got that part down. Clearbudget gives you the tools to get a clear picture of your financial situation, and then act on it.
