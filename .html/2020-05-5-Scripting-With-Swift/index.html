Eg: <code>cd Desktop/Scripts</code>.</p><p>Enter <code>touch main.swift</code> to create a new swift file.</p><p>Then, to make it executable change the chmod on the file with <code>chmod +x main.swift</code>. This makes it so your computer recognizes the file as something that can be run. Instead of something to read.</p><p>Launch Xcode (or another editor) and open your new swift file. Then add this bit to the top:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">#!/usr/bin/swift // This is crucial. Without it your script will not run.

print("Hello World")
</code></pre><p>Now, go back to your terminal and run the script using <code>./main.swift</code>. It should read something like</p><pre><code class="language-bash">user@Computer ~ % ./main.swift 
Hello World
user@Computer ~ % 
</code></pre><h2>You've done it!</h2><p>Now you have a running Swift script. You can add anything you want to the script, except things like UIKit or SwiftUI. Those won't work and you'll want Xcode's help using them.</p><p>Some ideas on what you could do:</p><ul><li>Twitter bots</li><li>Schedule a backup</li><li>Automatically copy-paste large folders</li><li>Automatically push a git repository</li><li>Retreive stock market data and save it in a local database</li><li>So much more!</li></ul><h3>One more thing to note</h3><p>Xcode's autocomplete will not work for scripts. So what I do is create a playground, write and debug the script and then when it's ready copy-paste it into the script file you just made. Then, you have autocomplete while writing the script.</p></article><footer><p>Copyright ©️ Khan Winter 2024</p><p>Built In Swift</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecoolwinter" rel="me">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://threads.net/thecoolwinter" rel="me">Threads</a> | <a href>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
