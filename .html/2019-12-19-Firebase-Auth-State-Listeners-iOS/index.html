My user might be disabled by an admin or a bot, or the account is stopped for security reasons. But, I need to update user interfaces and data code to match that the user is logged out.</p><h2>Fortunately its easy with firebase</h2><p>Somewhere in your startup code -I use a container view for all my views, but the AppDelegate or SceneManager works well here- put this snippet in.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">func setAuthListener() {
    Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeListener { (auth, user) in
        guard let user else {
            // The user is either logged out, or something went wrong. 
            // You can use the Auth.auth().currentUser.reload() function 
            // to try to find the error using the FIRErrorCode enum
            return
        }

        // Otherwise, we now have a signed in user. Usually that just means 
        // we carry on, but you could put some custom handler here too.
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Then just fire that function somewhere at the start of your app, or in a container controller like we made in <a href="https://windchillblog.com/2020/2/21/easy-container-controllers-in-swift">this</a> article.</p></article></div><footer><p>Copyright ©️ Khan Winter 2024</p><p>Built In Swift</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thecoolwinter" rel="me" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://threads.net/thecoolwinter" rel="me" target="_blank">Threads</a> | <a href>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
