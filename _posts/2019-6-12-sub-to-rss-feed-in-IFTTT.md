# Subscribing to RSS feeds using IFTTT
### Then send a notification through firebase

There's an author named Patrick Rothfus. He's my favorite author, written some awesome books and happens to have a blog. So since I'm eagery awaiting the announcement of his next book, I decided to make a RSS notification app. The app would send a notification whenever Patrick posted a new blog post.

There will be two steps to this project:

1. Setup IFTTT
2. Add cloud function to send notifications to apps in firebase



[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) (IF This Then That) is a sevice that allows you to set up events with triggers, these can be things like an Alexa job, a Twitter feed update, or a new RSS feed post.
